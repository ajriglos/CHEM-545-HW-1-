There is two python codes that are added this repository extract_parameter function and calculate_solution_weights function. They are regular python code and can be run in jupyter notebooko or any environmen that is python friendly. 
The extract_parameter function helps to determine parameters that are set by the user. For example given a list with different parameters for a machine such as a distiller or a chiller it can help to determine the parameter for distillation column and then the first temperature. It can be useful to pull more direct informtion. 
The calculate_solution_weights function is a quicker way to gain weight/mass of a chemical. It takes a list of molecular weights and the concentrations needed and can calculate the weight of the chemical needed. You would need to supply the molecular weight and concentration wanteded and it can be really quick and will return an unknown if not supplied.
